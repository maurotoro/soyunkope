Simple implementation of an idea for data visuallization,
Would it be cool to have a holographic figure that you can control and unravel the information in "proper" 3D?

The small code snippet hologram_test creates a plot and projects it in different angles to create a video that can be viewed with a pepperghost pyramid
It's quite a hacky solution, but it does the trick

Think that you could help? Please Do!
